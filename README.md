# Uninformed Search Lab

This Lab was done for Intelligent Systems class in ITESM Qro. The goal is to implement an A* search with heuristic = 0 (UCS), any consistent heuristic and any inconsistent heuristic.

## How to Run

To run the UCS (Uniform Cost Search) type `ucs < {input file}`.

To run the A* with a consistent heuristic rype `run < {input file`.

To run the A* with an inconsistent heuristic rype `a_star_incons < {input file`.

Example input files are: a.in, b.in or c.in

The first line is the height limit in stacks, second line is the start state, and the third line is the goal state.
